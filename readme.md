# Presentation on Berger's Holonomy Classification

**Title:** Berger's Classification of Riemannian Holonomies

**Abstract:**
I will begin with recaping facts about Riemannian Holonomy, and submanifold geometry. Then I'll  discuss reduicble and symmetric spaces to state and prove the Normal Holonomy theorem. Finally I prove the Berger Holonomy Theorem and provide the Berger's list of Holonomies.
